Goal
----
What do we want this webpage to do?

1. Allow users (multiple; at least two) to sign in and out with their own credentials management
2. users can add a single value -- their weight on that day -- to the db. This can be updated throughout the day as desired
3. display one page with several different mini-competition statii
4. Each user gets their own summary page
